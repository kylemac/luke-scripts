Luke's Build Scripts
====================

A series of build scripts to automate some of his work

### Building Directories for Dailes
This is controlled in Makefile

- open terminal
- `cd` into the directory that you want the folders to be inserted (typically `/Volumes/RAID_ID`)
- `make build`
- profit! 

> **to remove directories:** run `make unbuild`
